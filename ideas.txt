Every trinket has a base effect that can't be modified
Then there are secondary effects that can be rerolled
There are also trinket qualities:
  - volatile: trinket has a single usage (in case it's a trinket with usage) or else timeout
  - normal: normal usage
  - rare: better effects
  - legendary: effects are amplified even more
